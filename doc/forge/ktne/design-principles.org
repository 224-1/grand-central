* How Forge games shold work
-----
** (te)N commandments
- Data First Gaming - Work up from what data you want to collect (make data and dashboards a vital part of game play)
- No idling - make sure all players are engaged
- Easy Learning Curve - Reduce onboarding time for gameplay
- Scale - Design for large numbers of players / teams competing at the same time
- Ease of Use - prioritise speed and ease of use for non core gameplay functions (no unnecessary animations)
- Endless Tunnel - levels dont end, they keep coming at you (like subway surf)
- Strategizing - strategising and setting goals and targets should happen in game (and be captured for analytics)
- Viewability - it should be fun for an audience to watch the game, and understand whats happening, pick sides, and enjoy the journey
- Fun - the player is the master of a weird fun universe, never make the player a pawn in an experiment. Make all of the above improve the players sense of control of the universe, not the other way around.
